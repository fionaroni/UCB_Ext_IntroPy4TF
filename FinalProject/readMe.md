This is the folder for Zhicheng (Jason) Xue and Shiwen (GiGi) Wang's final project for X433.7 machine learning with TensorFlow.
Please note that Part V of the code is the section where you can find our TensorFlow models while the other parts are either data preparations or benchmark model.
In order to run the program, you just need to download the .py script and loan.csv file. If you want to compare against our results, please check the uploaded Jupyter Notebook file and all the pictures in the folder.
