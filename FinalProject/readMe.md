This is the folder for Zhicheng (Jason) Xue and Shiwen (GiGi) Wang's final project for X433.7 machine learning with TensorFlow.


Please note that Part V in the code is the section where you can find our TensorFlow models while the other codes in front are either data preparations or scikit learn model.


In order to run the program, you need to get all the packages listed in the code(Final_Project_X4337.py) and data(loan.csv). We suggeste to ues Jupiter notebook to run the code to avoid certain errors. If you want to compare against our results, please check the uploaded Jupyter Notebook file and all the pictures in the folder.
